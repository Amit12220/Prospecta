Ans-the key Things that i would consider while creating/consuming Api to ensure it is secure and reliable:-
1.provide login or any other type of security so that no other person able to change or disturb anythings in Api.
2.while  creating it would better for us to handle exception so that caller does not get unnecssary details;
3.all the annotations should be perfect.
